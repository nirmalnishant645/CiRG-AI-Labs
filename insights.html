        <h4>Green Economy for Aviation Industry</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Global warming is a serious threat to people and ecosystems, and there is a strong need for
dramatically reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, to reduce that risk. Civil aviation accounts for 2 percent of global Carbon Dioxide(CO2) emissions and when its non-CO2 impacts are factored in, it contributes 4.9 per cent of the Earth’s warming effect. Dramatic growth is forecasted in the demand for air travel over the next couple of decades in all geographic regions, with annual  growth rates in Revenue Passenger Kilometres between 2010 and 2030 ranging from 3 to 6.2 percent. Even allowing for new technology, fuel projections out to 2050 show a 270 percent increase against 2006 levels, with levels in 2050 equivalent to 2,200 Mt of CO2 per annum; this is approximately 11 per cent of global CO2 emissions on a less than 2˚ C degree trajectory. According to UNEP, combined emissions from shipping and aviation may represent as much as 10.0 to 32.5 per cent of median total emissions in 2050. With the onset of the 2020 era, humans are observing its repercussions in terms of forest burning, pandemics etc.
 It's vital to shift this sector as much as possible to the renewable sources of energy.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Think of how the latest technologies assist in developing potential options for curbing emissions in this sector. Technologies like AI  considers the environmental, economic and political consequences of potential market based mechanisms, and offers an overall assessment of climate policy in this sector.

        <h4>AGI: Artificial General Intelligence</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Homo Sapiens aka humans are considered to be the most advanced form in life existing stories. This category of vertebra is different from other because of the component called “Intelligence”. As human has progress further they are attempting to built another similar vertebra called “machines”. There is an attempt going around the world to make these machines intelligent enough to solve those “real-time problems” which may sooner or later are posing threat to human existence such as climate change. None of the system today is truely an intelligent one. Current world working on AI, doesn’t talk much about Intelligence, it’s a machine feeded by data and some mathematical computational logics bringing the decision making. It’s more likely a theoretical AI rather than an actual AI. The term actual AI refers here to “Cognition”.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: justify;">
          Cognition means understanding the psychology behind delivering a work. In an attempt to make human level intelligent machine we are attempting to write the psychology in the Computer Science form. We can summarize psychology in crisp terminologies such as
Understanding; Consciousness; Meaning; Learning; Creativity; Culture; Elaboration; Imagination; Passion; Communication; Thinking; Emotions; Adaption; Belief; Forget; Six Sense.
Now, writing these things in a programmable way, can help us developing common sense in machine. This term is known as Artificial General Intelligence.
How to bring it in existence? To bring human level intelligence, we need to understand the cognitive level of architecture.

        <h4>Alternative Methodology: Plasma Physics for fighting against the Coronavirus (CoVs)</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          All objects have resonant frequencies at which they naturally oscillate. Pluck a guitar string and it will vibrate at a resonant frequency. But resonating can get out of control. A famous example is the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which warped and finally collapsed in 1940 due to a wind that rocked the bridge back and forth at one of its resonant frequencies.
<br>
Viruses are susceptible to the same kind of mechanical excitation. An experimental group led by K. T. Tsen from Arizona State University have recently shown that pulses of laser light can induce destructive vibrations in virus shells. "The idea is that the time that the pulse is on is about a quarter of a period of a vibration," Sankey said. "Like pushing a child on a swing from rest, one impulsive push gets the virus shaking."
If the shell of any virus can be compromised [by mechanical vibrations], then it can be inactivated.
<br>
Composition of virus. CoVs are positive-stranded RNA viruses with a crown-like appearance under an electron microscope (coronam is the Latin term for crown) due to the presence of spike glycoproteins on the envelope.
Among the structural elements of CoVs, the spike glycoproteins composed of two subunits (S1 and S2). Homotrimers of S proteins compose the spikes on the viral surface, guiding the link to host receptors.[8] Of note, in SARS-CoV-2, the S2 subunit — containing a fusion peptide, a transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain — is highly conserved. Thus, it could be a target for antiviral (anti-S2) compounds. On the contrary, the spike receptor-binding domain presents only a 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-CoVs. Other structural elements on which research must necessarily focus are the ORF3b that has no homology with that of SARS-CoVs and a secreted protein (encoded by ORF8), which is structurally different from those of SARS-CoV. Therefore it is being called a Novel Coronavirus.

Approach I. Resonating frequency of an Ultraviolet Radiation
<br>
Descriptions<br>
The total dose to which an airborne virus was exposed was defined as the product of the UVGI intensity I on the microbe and the exposure time t. The survival fraction is a ratio that represents the virus concentration after UVGI exposure, and defined as
<br>
where<br>
[N ,uv =] concentration of airborne virus surviving after exposure to UVGI by using one-stage Andersen sampler (PFU/m3)<br>
[N 0 =] concentration of airborne virus unexposed to UVGI by using one-stage Andersen sampler (PFU/m3)<br>
[I =] UV intensity (μ W/cm2)<br>
[t =] UV exposure time (sec)<br>
[K =] microorganism susceptibility factor (cm2/μW sec)
<br>
CoVS contains a single-stranded RNA, so to work with UV to destroy it, you need
339-423 microwatt per second per square of cm2 of ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 254 nm to get 90% air disinfection by measurements.
The power of light decreases inversely with distance, so all viruses will die in 1 second inside a sphere with a radius of 1.4 meters at UV lamp power of 100 Watts. Based on the literature data in my previous letter, it is necessary to have a value A = 400 micro Watts per 1 cm2 = 4 W\m2 for 1 second. If you take a lamp with a power of 200 Watts, then all viruses inside a sphere with a radius of 2 meters will die in 1 second.
<br>
Benefits<br>
Now it’s necessary use reliably UV disinfection inside airports, subway cars, inside all rooms in hospitals
together with patients. These simple techniques are mercury lamps that are known for today. The radiation
will ensure all disinfection of clothing, hair and skin of people, the treatment is useful and does not
cause harm for man (only the eyes should be protected under glasses or closed for a few minutes). It has
long been known that it is ultraviolet with a wavelength of about 0.15 to 0.4 microns kills all microbes
and viruses carefully.

        <h4>Dolphin Intelligence</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          A researcher based in Miami, decided to use CymaScope, a device that makes sound visible, for just this purpose. He recorded the sounds produced by a dolphin when “seeing” objects, then turned them into images and showed them to the same dolphin again, this time without sound accompaniment. The results showed that the dolphin managed to recognize the objects that corresponded to the images with an 86 % accuracy. Moreover, when the researcher showed the same pictures to another dolphin, it recognized the objects with the same accuracy! This suggests that cetaceans use sounds to communicate with each other in a similar way that we use words.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: justify;">
          Humans have the highest EQ at 7.4, but bottlenose dolphins have EQs of 5.3, significantly higher than other animals. Therefore dolphin and humans have a lot of similarities between them which could be explained by following facts:<br>
Research  has  shown  that  Dolphins  can imitate  human  actions  and  even  how  they  solve  problems. When a dolphin has one of its senses blocked, it can use other senses to mimic a human's movements. This is explained in the website-http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/09/dolphins-problem-like-humans/2635225/.<br>
Bottle-nose Dolphins also have  its own unique ‘signature whistle’ by which they not only “talk” to each other, but remember each other for longer period of time. This is explained in the more detail -http://news.discovery.com/animals/whales-dolphins/dolphin-update-what-do-we-know-130812.htm
Dolphins may use complex nonlinear mathematics to assist their echolocation hunting and navigation. This is discussed in the link- http://news.discovery.com/animals/whales-dolphins/dolphins-math-geniuses-120717.htm
<br>
Using echolocation, dolphins might be able to detect a pregnant woman's developing fetus, some experts say. They emit sounds in their environment and listen to the echoes that return — a process that helps them to identify the shapes and locations of objects.
<br>
Dolphins also display culture, something long believed to be unique to humans. In May 2005, Australia found Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins teaching their young ones to use tools by covering their snouts with sponges to protect themselves while foraging. Using sponges as mouth protection is a learned behavior.
<br>
Also have ability to focus on tasks and has ability to remain attentive for longer periods and to make discrimination between critical and non-critical images.
<br>
Research suggests that bottlenose dolphins are self-aware, a trait which is considered to be a sign of highly-developed, abstract thinking. One such indicator is that they have been able to recognize themselves in a mirror.
<br>
To prevent drowning while sleeping only half of the dolphin’s brain goes to sleep while the other half remains awake so that  they can continue to breathe.This ability of dolphin helps them to stay and help injured individuals, even helping them to the surface to breath.
